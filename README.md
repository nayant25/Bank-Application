The bank has different type of accounts:

Savings Account
Salary Account
Current Account
Loan Account
A savings account is typically used by an individual for personal usage and it is necessary for the account to have an average minimum balance of 10000 rs..

A Salary account is exactly similar to a savings account except that it has a time limit in which at least one transaction should have taken place. If no transactions happen on a salary account for two months, the account is frozen and the account holder is notified.

A current account does not have any such facilities or restrictions. The current account allows the customer to have an overdraft facility, where the customer will have a maximum limit set that he can withdraw over the current balance.

A loan account can keep track of the amount of loan repaid by a specific customer who has taken a loan from the bank. It acts as a standard savings account, but has an initial balance of negative (loan amount), and interest is also calculated accordingly..
